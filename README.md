Reflective analysis

The map that I have created aims to show the locations and magnitudes of global earthquakes in 2018. In the map, earthquakes are represented by green circles 
of various sizes based on their magnitude (data points ranged from 2.5 to 5.6 on the richter scale). These circles are accompanied by data labels that correspond
with earthquake magnitudes. I thought that this was an important feature to include on my map because it allows viewers to know the exact magnitude of the 
earthquakes, rather than relying solely on proportional symbol interpretation. I chose a red, white, and black color palette as I found it most effectively 
conveyed the data in a simple way, as well as providing the map with a more modern feel The high contrast between the land and water surfaces (black and white) 
serve to balance the map by not distracting the viewer from the red proportional symbols. This causes the viewer’s eye to naturally migrate towards the data 
points, making for an easier viewing experience. My map works on multiple zoom levels primarily through the data labels, which only appear when the viewer zooms 
in enough for the separate data points to be easily discernible with minimal overlap.

While I do believe that simplicity is the key to any successful visualization of data, I think that my map could be improved by considering other data points 
like earthquake duration, cost of damage, or a visualization of the areal extent of the earthquakes. This is something that I talked with another student about 
in a critique session, however I wasn’t able to figure out how to show these features on my map. Moreover, there was also a considerable lack of additional data 
that I was able to find that would be appropriate for my map, so I elected to keep it simple and just show the location and magnitude of each event. Another way 
that I could have improved my map is by including some form of an interactive element, which would most likely be a mouse-over action for displaying additional 
information such as quake duration, date of occurrence, and (possible) injuries and deaths.
